Welcome to the preliminary phase of our mealworm detection and identification model â€” an innovative initiative driven by Computer Vision, carefully developed in collaboration with the **Laboratory of Bioinformatics and Omics Sciences (LaBiOmics)** at the **University of Mogi das Cruzes (UMC)**, under the supervision of **Prof. Dr. Fabiano B. Menegidio**.

**Explore the World of Edible Insects:**

In a global scenario where the search for sustainable food sources is on the rise, insects are emerging as a promising solution. In particular, mealworms have gained prominence for their nutritional value and the reduced environmental impact associated with their cultivation.

Our computer vision project, dedicated to the detection and identification of mealworms, stands as a pivotal advancement in this movement. It offers an efficient and precise tool to support the sustainable production of edible insects.

**Innovative Solutions through Computer Vision:**

Developed on the Roboflow platform, our model harnesses the latest strides in computer vision to identify and categorize mealworms with exceptional accuracy. Driven by intelligent algorithms and specialized training, this tool can distinguish between different developmental stages of the mealworm, providing a comprehensive solution for producers and researchers alike.

**Importance for Biotechnology, Biomedical Engineering, and Public Policies:**

Furthermore, we highlight the relevance of this project to the fields of Biotechnology and Biomedical Engineering. The ability to identify and understand mealworms through computer vision has significant implications in biomedical research, opening doors for studies on potential medicinal and pharmaceutical applications of these insects.

Moreover, the project also stands out in the realm of public policies, providing a valuable tool for governments and organizations seeking to promote sustainable and safe agricultural practices, aligned with the growing demands for food and environmental concerns.
